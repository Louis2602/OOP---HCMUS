###DerivedB db2(2.7);

###DerivedB db3(3,2.7);
Base constructor-1 param is called because class DerivedB inherits a parameter from the Base class 
DerivedB constructor-2 param
###DerivedB db4(db2);
Base copy constructor
DerivedB copy constructor
- Base copy constructor is called because class DerivedB passes an obj to the Base class so the Base copy constructor is called, then DerivedB copy constructor is called afterwards.

- The destructor is called from bottom to top

<h1>In conclusion</h1>
<p>The constructor is called from top to bottom, which is from base class to derived class</p>
<p>The destructor is called from bottom to top followed the reversed order of objs are previously created</p>
